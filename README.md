# Task Master TODO App

## Project overview

Task Master is a PWA written with Vue.js and TypeScript. It's a basic CRUD app for managing lists of things needing to be done.

### Why Vue?

Vue is a powerful and approachable framework for building web applications. The single file components are easy to manage, and most of the choices around the tooling have already been made. I like that Vue includes a router, state management, and styling solution out of the box.

I was already very familiar with Vue as well, so I wanted to spend more time mastering advanced features of the tool while building this app.

### Why TypeScript?

I spent some time experimenting with Swift and Flutter (Dart) - which are very different from JavaScript. I liked the specificity of Swift's type system and wanted to try applying those principles to JS using TS.

The "self documenting" aspect of TypeScript has been really helpful for my app, and I do feel like I have fewer bugs in my code (even if it took a little longer to write).

### Why a PWA?

I love the web and have often bragged about the power of PWAs, but never written one myself. I wanted to see if I was able to make something useful as a PWA (not just a Hello World app) and develop an honest opinion about the technology.
